== Introduction

The Restaurant Management System (RMS) provides restaurants with a more efficient way to manage their operations. It has a wide variety of features which cater to different roles in a restaurant. In line with Singapore's "Smart Nation" movement, the RMS aims to digitise the restaurant business and make day-to-day operations smoother and simpler. Jump to <<Setting up>> to get started.

== Quick Start

.  Open up src/seedu.addressbook folder.
.  Right Click on `Main`.
.  Click `Run Main.main()`.
