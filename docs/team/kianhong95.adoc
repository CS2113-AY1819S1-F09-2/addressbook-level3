== PROJECT: Restaurant Management System

---

== Overview

Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a desktop restaurant management application used to help restaurant managers oversee their various processes in a more elegant and efficient way.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added employee management features.
** What it does: Allows restaurant mangers using the system to list, add, edit and delete employees from the system. Additionally, employees of the restaurant can clock in and clock out their attendance in the system.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a restaurant manger can mange his/her employees in a more efficient way.
** Highlights: Needed to ensure that the commands implemented would be easy to understand and use for a non-tech savvy audience. The commands had to properly take care of invalid command formats and guide the user with examples on how to properly use the command when such invalid command formats are encountered.
